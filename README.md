# Bank Customer Churn Prediction


# About
This project aims to predict bank customer churn using machine learning. It includes a machine learning model built using Python and a simple web-based user interface to interact with the model predictions.

# Project Structure
  1. churn_model.py: Python script containing the machine learning model and data preprocessing steps.
  2. home.html: HTML file for the user interface.
  3. Churn_Modelling.csv: Dataset used for training and testing the model.
  4. trained_model.pkl: Serialized trained Random Forest Classifier model (uncomment the code to save it).
